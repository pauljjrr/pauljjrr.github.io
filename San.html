			  Jasmine has had 2 of her 3 mock exam results: Grade A for Chemistry, Grade A for Biology. She finds out her Maths results today (She needs another A!). Her driving is going very well, (slow, but very smooth and safe).
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  Jack is back at University. (here again on Monday). He has had 2 A's at uni recently. He has had his braces removed!!! He is thinking of summer in Taiwan! His driving is also going well, (Obviously he's at uni most of the time so we dont get as much practice in, but he is doing good).
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  Noun is coming round often, she is very happy with Blake, Still working at The Bakehouse, Still as energetic as ever. Her driving is still a worry though!
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			  We have all been climbing - see the attached videos:
